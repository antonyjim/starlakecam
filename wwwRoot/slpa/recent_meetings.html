		<p><b><a name="August_26,_2017">August 26, 2017</a> Annual Dinner Meeting 
		at the Star Lake Haven</b></p>
<p><b><i>
		Call to 
		Order</i></b></p>
		<p>The meeting of 
		the Star Lake Protective Association was called to order at 6:00 pm by 
		President Vito T. after a “meet and greet” cocktail hour at The 
		Haven of Star Lake’s main lodge.</p>
		<p>
Vito welcomed 
		everyone and introduced the 2017 officers. Guests/speakers were also 
		introduced: Tom and Veronica Russell from the Trout Lake Assn.; Eric 
		Paul, Derrick Towne and Karen Allen, from Paul Smith’s Adirondack 
		Watershed Institute; and Arlene and Mark Davis, from Cranberry Lake. 54 
		members and guests attended.</p>
		<p>
<b>Available 
		Literature</b> for 
		members included the latest <i>New York State Boaters’ Guide</i> and a 
		number of brochures about invasive species. <i>Star Lake Handbook</i>s 
		were also available for sale. </p>
		<p>
<b><i>
		
		Approval of Minutes</i>
		</b>Copies were 
		available for members’ inspection. Richard R. made a motion; 
		seconded by Karen R., to approve the minutes of the June 24, 2017 
		Regular Meeting as presented. With no discussion, the motion was 
		carried.</p>
		<p> 
		<b><i>
		Treasurer’s Report</i>
		</b>Chris C. gave 
		the Treasurer’s Report. Beginning balance as of 6/24/17 was $7,987.94. 
		Revenues were $520 from dues; $60 in contributions; $15 from the sale of
		<i>Star Lake Handbooks</i>; and $269 from the Poker Run. Revenues 
		totaled $864.00. Payments included $204.49 reimbursement to Bo 
		R. including $62.60 for a gift for Tess G.; $18.60 for 
		meeting costs; $28.74 for name labels; $20 for two gift certificates for 
		the poker run; and $74.55 for three ads in the <i>Bargain Hunter</i>. 
		Total expenses were $1,010.11. $100 was paid to Joe R. to sponsor 
		the SOS 5-K walk/run t-shirts; $500 was donated to the Wilderness 
		HealthCare Foundation; $50 in dues was paid to the Adirondack Lake 
		Alliance (ALA); $100 was paid in a memorial donation to honor Jack 
		Leffert, former SLPA officer; and $55.62 was paid to Daphne H. 
		for June meeting refreshments. The ending balance, as of August 26<sup>th</sup>, 
		2017 is $7,841.83. </p>
		<p>
		There were 61 members and 
		2 associate members to date, not including those who paid at the 
		meeting. Motion was made by Mike B., seconded by Deb B. to approve 
		the treasurer’s report. The motion was carried.</p>
		<p>
		<b>Tribute to Tess G.
		</b>Vito introduced 
		Tess G., treasurer for 25 years, to the group. He read the text of 
		a certificate of appreciation and presented a gift basket to Tess in 
		thanks for her many years of dedicated service to the SLPA. A standing 
		ovation for a surprised Tess followed.</p>
		<p> <i>
		<b>Old 
		Business</b></i></p>
		<p>
<b>Social 
		Committee Report </b>
		Vito thanked the social 
		committee for making the dinner arrangements for this meeting and for 
		their contributions throughout the year. </p>
		<p>
><b>Poker Run
		</b>Steve G. 
		reported that the 13<sup>th</sup> Annual Poker Run, held August 5<sup>th 
		(</sup>“Cinco de August”), was a success in spite of windy, cold 
		weather. There were 110 hands yielding $269 for the treasury before 
		expenses. Pam T. won first place with a flush. As the weather was 
		not so pleasant, threatening rain, there wasn’t much of a party on the 
		sandbar. Since Deb B. won the prize for decoration again, she had to 
		pick the theme for next year’s poker run. Deb said that the theme next 
		year is ‘80’s movies. Vito thanked Steve G., Chris C., Tess 
		G., Bo R., as well as Marty R., Lenny &amp; Linda G., Rovie H., Pat &amp; Carol 
		S., and Joe &amp; Margie R., who manned the 
		five card stations. </p>
		<p>
><b>Lake 
		Clean-ups</b> Vito 
		thanked those who participated in the road cleanup and the shoreline 
		cleanup. One more road cleanup will occur on September 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>

		Invasive Species Committee </b>
		
		Richard R. and Hank M. introduced our guest speakers from Paul 
		Smith’s Adirondack Watershed Institute (AWI) from Saranac Lake. Hank 
		said that since 1901, the SLPA’s mission has been to take good care of 
		the lake. We need to be aware of how to keep the lake clean and the 
		people from Paul Smith’s are here to help us with that. A slide 
		presentation and discussion about invasive species in the Adirondacks 
		followed introductions. Derrick Towne is Regional Supervisor of the 
		Cranberry-Long Lake Region of the AWI; Karen Allen is a watershed 
		steward of the same region; and Eric Paul started as a watershed steward 
		in Cranberry Lake and in 2016, became a Regional Director for the 
		Southwest Region which includes Star Lake. Watershed stewards’ 
		responsibilities are to educate the public about aquatic invasive 
		species, interact with the public at boat launches and help perform 
		watercraft inspections to prevent the spread of invasive species. For 
		more info, go to
		<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.adkwatershed.org/">
		http://www.adkwatershed.org/</a>. Highlights of their presentation 
		follow.</p>
		<p> 
		AWI goal is to test every B. of water within the Park—water monitoring 50 
		streams and 90 lakes; Aquatic invasive species (AIS) management and 
		surveillance of 120 lakes and AIS spread prevention via 76 boat 
		wash/inspection stations.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Surveillance and dive teams collect invasives. Tom Russell asked if 
		they help lakes outside the park—Derrick said “yes, sometimes.” 
		</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		65,000 watercrafts were inspected at boat wash stations this year with 
		1,100 decontaminations, over 3,000 AIS interceptions. They described the 
		wash procedure and showed slides of contaminated boats. </p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		It’s the law: no watercraft can be launched in NY without inspection for 
		AIS and cleaning. </p>
		<p> 
		
		
		Why 
		bother? To prevent spread of AIS, control allows time to develop new 
		methods and to protect pristine waters.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Adirondacks are comparatively clean—70% of lakes are AIS-free; only 12 
		AIS established in Adirondack region. 98 known lakes have AIS. 
		Invasion progresses from introduction to establishment to expansion to 
		naturalization. Hopes are to prevent introduction.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		AIS 
		plants found (#of waters): Eurasian watermilfoil (60), variableleaf 
		milfoil (43 incl. Cran. Lake), Curlyleaf pondweed (15), European frogbit 
		(5), fanwort (4) and waterchestnut (3). AIS animals: spiny waterflea 
		(8), zebra mussel (2), and Asian clam (1 Lake George only).</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Derrick passed around samples of waterfleas and waterchestnut. He 
		discussed classification of species: Native (indigenous), non-native 
		(accidental intro from outside), invasive (non-native rapidly 
		reproduces, displaces native species, causes ecological and economic 
		damage), and nuisance (interferes with human activity).</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Invasives lack predators, disease and parasites; are prolific 
		reproducers by both seed and vegetative growth; colonize wide areas and 
		can dominate area depriving light/nutrients. A question was raised: 
		where do they come from? —Boats, trailors, gear. Problems follow the 
		roadways—there is very little impact on deep woods areas of the 
		Adirondacks.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Slides of invasive plants and animals were shown along with pictures of 
		site contaminations.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Economic impact is great: $120 billion nationwide per year; $3.56 
		million spent by 88 organizations in the Adirondacks in 2014; reduces 
		property values; and negatively impacts tourism.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Described Upper Chateaugay Lake’s cost of doing nothing. Went from 
		manageable but un-noticed infestation ($10,000/yr.) in 2002 to 30% 
		reduction in usable area in 2006 ($2 million/yr.).</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Star Lake decontamination station inspected 167 and washed 122 vessels. 
		50 came from Cranberry Lake, 12 from the Oswegatchie River, 7 from Fish 
		Creek Ponds, 6 from the St. Lawrence River, 4 from the Erie Canal, and 1 
		from Cayuga Lake (29 from ?). AIS found were: 1 curly-leaf pondweed, 9 
		Eurasian milfoil, 1 variable-leaf milfoil, 1 waterchestnut and 2 zebra 
		mussels—these all were kept from introduction into our waters. Chris 
		W. asked about personal watercrafts—yes, they can spread AIS and are 
		easy to launch. Hank M. asked if they were stopping for 
		inspections—not so much. A question was raised about problems with the 
		DEC carry-on launch site—we should contact the DEC directly. Lake 
		Bonaparte AIS problems were mentioned—there has been some progress 
		there. A question was raised about AIS’s effect on fishing—yes, fish 
		population can be reduced by AIS spread.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		A 
		2016 shoreline survey of Star Lake revealed no AIS, which is very good 
		news for us. </p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Eric suggested things we can do for Star Lake: Volunteer and collect 
		baseline data for Star Lake (they will train us and provide volunteer 
		uniforms, a tablet to collect data and will help us to analyze the data 
		and assess our risk). Eric suggested contacting land owners where boats 
		can be launched to inform them of risks and suggest steps to take to 
		minimize AIS exposure. He suggested that we establish a “lake steward” 
		to interact with the public.</p>
		<p> 
		
		
		
		Karen Allen spoke of her experiences as a lake steward at the Cranberry 
		Lake boat launch. As a steward, she was able to have quick conversations 
		with boaters and suggested that the boats be inspected for AIS. She 
		perceived her job as listening to boaters and being open with them in 
		providing information about invasive species and how they are 
		introduced.</p>
		<p>
<b>Guest 
		Speaker Arlene Davis </b>
		Richard R. introduced 
		Arlene by stating that our interest in Star Lake is to educate and 
		inform people around the lake. He told the group of an instance where 
		owners of the Haven restricted a non-inspected boat from launching at 
		their property, as they had not had their boat inspected at the boat 
		wash site. Unfortunately, there was no one at the boat wash site; so, 
		the guests did not launch at all. It’s good that word is getting out 
		and that the Haven owners are good “lake stewards.”</p>
		<p>
Arlene has 
		represented the CLBC’s (Cranberry Lake Boat Club) Invasive Species 
		Committee for 18 years. She has done water sampling with ALAP 
		(Adirondack Lake Assessment Program) in Cranberry Lake and has 
		participated in shoreline surveys assisted and trained by APIPP 
		(Adirondack Park Invasive Plant Program). Important points of Arlene’s 
		presentation follow:</p>
		<p> 
		
		Arlene said 
		that variable leaf milfoil, once considered native, has been found in 
		Cranberry Lake, but has not posed much of a problem.</p>
		<p> 
		
		The 
		prevention route is very important. We are fortunate to have stewards 
		at the boat launch and a boat wash station nearby. The rapid response 
		team is very good.</p>
		<p> 
		
		Cranberry 
		Lake Boat Club’s goals include conducting shoreline surveys; but, with 
		79 miles of shoreline, it makes it difficult. They have received grants 
		(Damoth Foundation) for survey equipment and have purchased scopes and 
		weed rakes. They have made plant guides and maps available. An annual 
		survey of the lake’s shoreline is a goal, in order to stay ahead of the 
		problem. Getting people to embrace the AIS problem is important.</p>
		<p> 
		
		The CLBC is 
		associated with the APIPP for training and support. Arlene said that 
		they are able to collect samples of suspicious plants in baggies and 
		send them to APIPP for identification. (<i>note: The SLPA’s Pete and 
		Margie Kress received training from the APIPP years ago and we conducted 
		our own shoreline survey—no invasives found</i>)</p>
		<p> 
		
		Arlene said 
		that ALA (Adirondack Lake Associations) membership is important (<i>note: 
		SLPA is also a member</i>)</p>
		<p> 
		
		Arlene has 
		done ALAP water sampling for 18 years and coordinates with Mike and 
		Marylou M. (who do Star Lake ALAP testing) to get samples to Saranac 
		Lake for analysis.<b> </b></p>
		<p>
Vito thanked 
		Arlene for her important information.</p>
		<p>
<b>Canadian 
		Geese Problem</b> 
		This nuisance has been discussed in past meetings. Vito asked the 
		group for a simple vote as to whether the SLPA should pursue legal 
		solutions to ease the problem in the future. The vast majority of the 
		group supported further action.</p>
		<p>
<b>2018 
		Proposed Calendar </b>
		Bo R. directed the 
		group’s attention to the back of the agenda which contained suggested 
		dates for next year. He suggested that there are probably many people 
		who are not in town the week before the 4<sup>th</sup> of July and Labor 
		Day and are therefore not able to attend the two meetings. Also, many 
		members are not available during the week for cleanups. Overwhelming 
		input was in favor of keeping the meetings the week before the holidays 
		and for having the cleanups during the week. (<i>Note: members 
		coming to Star Lake for Labor Day weekend were not here to vote...</i>) Officers will review and 
		set the dates. </p>
		<p>
<b>
		
		2018 Membership Dues </b>Chris 
		C. indicated that the current level of dues at $20 for regular 
		membership and $10 for associate membership is adequate and need not be 
		changed. A question was raised as to what the difference was between a 
		regular member and an associate member. Chris said that an associate 
		member has no voting rights. Bo R. commented that the by-laws 
		define the two members: A regular member owns property on the lake and 
		that there can be only one regular member per property, regardless of 
		multiple tax numbers. An associate member is anyone who does not own 
		property on the lake; but has a special interest in the lake. Associate 
		members have all the rights of a regular member except voting rights. 
		Tom Russell said that on Trout Lake, they charge the same dues for 
		regular and associate members. A motion by Chris C., seconded by 
		Marty R. to not change member dues was passed and dues shall 
		remain at current levels.<b> </b></p>
		<p>
<b>
		
		Election of Officers for 2018 </b>
		
		Steve G., our nominating committee, suggested a 2018 slate comprised 
		of current 2017 officers of Vito T. for president; Daphne 
		H. for vice president; Chris C. for treasurer and Bo 
		R. for secretary. He asked if there were any other nominations 
		from the floor. There were none, so Steve made the motion, seconded by 
		Marty R., for the secretary to cast one ballot to elect the 
		proposed slate of officers for 2018. Motion to accept the slate as 
		presented was carried. </p>
		<p> <i>
		<b>Other Business</b> </i>
	
		There was no further business.</p>
		<p> <i>
		<b>
		Adjournment</b> </i>
		
		Motion was made, seconded and carried to adjourn at 7:15 pm. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The group enjoyed a great meal consisting of a tossed salad, beef 
brisket, garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables, followed by a 
		delicious apple crisp with vanilla ice cream for dessert. After 
dinner, Vito thanked the staff of the Haven for their great 
service. The group 
		applauded the staff and left full of information and good food. 
		</p>

		<b><a name="June_24,_2017">June 24, 2017</a> Regular Meeting at the 
		Adirondack Exhibit Center</b></p>
		

<p><b><i>
Call to Order</i></b></p>
<p>
The meeting was 
called to order 10:10 am by Vito T., president. President Vito thanked the 
social committee for the refreshments, supplied by Coffee Fever. The officers 
were introduced. Current officers are: Vito T., president; Daphne H., 
vice-president; Chris C., treasurer; and Bo R., secretary. Attendees introduced 
themselves. 21 were in attendance. </p>
<p>
<b>Good/Bad 
Wildlife Sightings: </b>
Feets S. said that a loon had hatched eight days ago. Vito said he saw a pair 
of common mergansers with four babies— a rarity as no one had recalled 
mergansers nesting on Star Lake. Deb B. spoke of bald eagle sightings; Jan M. 
saw a woodchuck; Mike S. said he saw seven loons on June 1<sup>st</sup>; Pam T. 
saw a monarch butterfly; and Daphne told the group about a black and white 
rabbit that had been frequenting the Scott’s Point area. </p>
<p>
<b>Literature 
Available:</b> Vito told 
members that copies of the current <i>New York Boaters’ Guide</i> and the <i>
Federal Requirements &amp; Safety Tips for Recreational Boats</i> were available for 
the taking. Literature from the APIPP (Adirondack Park Invasive Plants Program) 
and invasive species information were also on the table for the taking. </p>
<p>
<b>Approval of 
Minutes:</b> Minutes to 
the August 27, 2016 meeting were available for discussion. Mike M. suggested a 
minor change in the number of loons noted in the loon survey. A motion was made 
by Debby B., seconded by John V., to approve the minutes as amended. Motion was 
carried. </p>
<p>
<b>Treasurer’s Report: 
</b>Chris C. gave the Treasurer’s 
Report: Beginning balance was $8,456.75. Receipts totaled $1,330.00, including 
$700 from dues, a $5 contribution and $625 from members for dinner at last 
August’s meeting. Expenses totaled $1,798.81, including $1,072.64 to the Haven 
at Star Lake for dinners at last August’s meeting; $275 to Mary Lou M. to 
reimburse water testing costs; $150 ($75 each) to the Wilderness Health 
Foundation and the SOS in memory of member George Persson; School taxes paid 
were $74.03, land taxes were $107.14. $120.00 was paid to Bo R. for secretary’s 
meeting expenses ($15), spring mailing costs ($97.05) and the annual fee for 
anonymous domain registration ($7.95). The ending balance was $7,987.94, which 
didn’t include dues received at the meeting. Prior to June 24<sup>th</sup>, 
there were 31 paid members. </p>
<p>
<b>Social Committee Report</b>—Daphne 
thanked the social committee members (Pam T., Marty R., and Karen R.) for their 
efforts in planning and organizing the dinner and other events. Daphne 
discussed 2017 SLPA events:</p>
<p> 
<b>Dinner Meeting </b>
Plans for the<b> </b>annual dinner 
meeting are almost finalized at the Haven at Star Lake once again this year on 
August 26<sup>th</sup>. Watch the <i>Bargain Hunter</i> for details. <b></b></p>
<p> 
<b>Poker Run </b>On<b>
</b>August 5<sup>th</sup>, people will register at the sandbar from noon to 1 pm 
as in the past. They will travel by watercraft to all five designated stations 
and their hands will be determined later at the sandbar. “Cinco de Agosto” will 
be this year’s theme.</p>
<p> 
<b>Lake Road Cleanups </b>
Daphne passed around a sign-up 
sheet for the two cleanups which will be held on Wednesday, July 12<sup>th</sup> 
and Wednesday, September 6<sup>th</sup>. Dates were changed to Wednesdays to 
avoid weekend conflicts. Karen R. asked if we could change to another day of 
the week, as she cannot make it on Wednesdays. Karen agreed to make calls to 
volunteers to set a different date for each cleanup. We will meet at the school 
parking lot at 9 am sharp. Daphne thanked those who signed up in the past.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Lake Shore Cleanup </b>
The shoreline cleanup last year 
yielded many cans, bottles, other debris and a tire. This year, we will hold 
another lake shore cleanup, to be held Wednesday, August 16<sup>th</sup>. 
Volunteers will meet at the sandbar at 1 pm where we will decide what shoreline 
areas each will cover. A signup sheet was circulated.</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><i>
<b>Old Business</b></i></h1>
<p>
<b>SLPA Website 
Update </b>– Bo R. said 
that the SLPA web site at
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.slpa.info/">
www.slpa.info</a> has been up for over ten years, since March, 2007. Bo 
reported that the 2017 username and password for the members’ area are in the 
agenda. The same username/password is used to view the web cam live.</p>
<p>
<b>Problems 
with DEC Carry-on Access </b>
People are using the DEC site as 
their own private beach for swimming and partying. Garbage, kids and foul 
language have been reported by neighbors to the DEC; offenders were gone before 
DEC officers arrived. Discussion followed. Mike M. spoke of garbage that they 
have picked up regularly and suggested that a “carry it in; carry it out” sign 
be placed at the sight. Jan M. suggested that adjacent property lines be marked 
to set beach boundaries for the carry-on site. Bo said he observed kids 
trespassing--jumping off a neighbor’s raft (told them to leave). Dick R. 
wondered if placing signs would be construed as condoning improper usage. Bo 
wondered if we even had a legal right to place signs, property owner and/or DEC 
permission should be sought. Vito suggested that signage should include 
suggested use of the free boat wash, prior to launching carry-ons. The best 
approach is for neighbors to continue to report abuse as it happens to the DEC 
or State Police (phone numbers are included on the agenda). A motion was made 
by Mike M., seconded by Feets S., to place a homemade sign per discussion above, 
contingent upon DEC/Owner approval. Motion was carried.</p>

<p>
<b>Nominating 
Committee </b>Vito asked 
Steve G. if he would seek nominations for the election of 2017 officers, to be 
held at the annual dinner meeting. Steve agreed if the present officers agreed 
to run again for another year. All agreed. Others, of course, can seek 
nomination.</p>
<p> <b>
Adirondack Park Invasive Plant 
Program (APIPP) </b>Dick 
R., of the Invasive Species committee, said that they had not spent any of the 
approved 2016 budget and did not need additional funding. Dick asked if there 
had been any feedback regarding the letter he and Hank M. had sent to lakefront 
owners in June. Daphne H. pointed out that there were many watercrafts being 
launched by people using the lake and inspection and washing should be 
addressed. Bo said that the logical follow-up to the letter should be 
contacting owners of properties where launching is possible and asking them to 
insist that boats be washed and clean prior to launch. Chris C. said that the 
DEC should add to the signage at the carry-on site requiring the use of the free 
boat wash prior to launch. </p>
<p> <b>
Adirondack Lake Alliance 
Membership </b>Dues are 
$50 per year. Motion was made by Deb B.; seconded by Steve G. to continue our 
membership in the ALA. Bo mentioned that they held a symposium once a year, in 
case anyone wished to attend and represent the SLPA. There was no interest 
expressed. Mike M. asked if we had considered membership in the Federation of 
Lake Associations, as they are headquartered in Lafayette where he lives. We 
once were members, but severed our ties when we asked for some support several 
years ago and received none.</p>
<p> <b>
Adirondack Lake Assessment Program 
(ALAP) Water Testing Results</b> 
Members were referred to Star Lake water quality test results summarized on the 
back of the agenda. The full ALAP report can be found at on the ALAP site at

<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.adkwatershed.org/files/alap_2016_report_.pdf">
http://www.adkwatershed.org/files/alap_2016_report_.pdf</a> 
(pp. 141-142). According to the 
report, the lake is in very good shape. John V. questioned the level of 
salinity (salt from road runoff) reported. Mike S. told the group that the 
levels reported were not concerning. Mike M. gave a short presentation about 
procedures used to collect water samples three times per summer season. The M.s 
have partnered with Arlene Davis, ALAP person from Cranberry Lake, to alternate 
taking samples to Paul Smith’s for analysis. Mike said that Arlene might be a 
good guest speaker for the group, as an invasive species resource. If 
interested, he would ask her to attend the August dinner meeting. Karen R. 
suggested the group would pay for dinner for two, as was customary in the past. 
</p>
<p>
<b>2017 
Coliform Testing </b>In 
addition to ALAP testing, the M.s have, for the past four years, tested several 
sites around the lake for fecal coliform. Mike said that they would test once 
again if the group was interested. Bo noted that costs for testing have gone 
down; but the M.s’ travel expenses should be reimbursed. A question was raised 
about results of past testing. Bo said that he was remiss in not summarizing 
results and that he would put that info together for the August meeting. Raised 
levels of coliforms were reported at the carry-on site (near the water pump 
house) and on the sandbar, where Canada geese collected in great numbers in the 
fall. Retesting was done at the pump house and test results were not duplicated 
(a good thing). Mike S. referred to the “240 standard” (240 coliforms per 100 
ml sample) used to determine dangerous levels of coliforms in water. Geese and 
coliforms led to a discussion about the goose problem. Bo gave background info, 
how Sue Westbrook, former Town of Fine supervisor, suggested we enlist the aid 
of the DEC. Bo said that even if we just located the nests in the springtime, 
we could oil the eggs and eliminate the families that stay on the lake all 
summer. Joe R. and Daphne H. said they would help locate nests next spring. 
Since testing is an annual program, John V. made a motion, seconded by Steve G. 
to approve up to $200 per year for future coliform testing to cover lab costs 
and sampling expenses delivering the samples to the lab. This is in addition to 
ALAP testing expenses already approved. The group agreed that this should be an 
annual expenditure as an on-going commitment and approved the motion. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Wilderness 
Healthcare Foundation </b>
Steve G. requested the use of the SLPA database to help with the WHF fundraising 
efforts for the hospital, as it contained names and addresses of all those 
around the lake. Bo suggested that names, addresses and tax map data were 
public information; but, e-mail addresses are more confidential in nature and 
should not be provided. Motion was made by Steve G., seconded by Mike S. for 
the SLPA to approve the use of its data for the purpose of developing a databank 
for WHF fundraising efforts. Motion was carried. Feets S., seconded by Steve 
G., then made a motion for the SLPA to make a donation of $500 to the Wilderness 
Healthcare Foundation. Pam T. spoke of the many activities of the WHF. Motion 
was carried. </p>
<p>
<b>Trout Lake 
Association Collaboration</b> 
Vito said that he was contacted by an officer of the Trout Lake Association 
about possible interest in SLPA members going with them on a bus trip to Tupper 
Lake to tour their two local breweries, followed by a meal. The trip is 
tentatively August 11<sup>th</sup> and more information with be forthcoming. 
There seemed to be little interest in the trip.</p>
<p>
<b>Adirondack 
Exhibit Center Funding Request </b>
Joe R. made a motion for the SLPA 
to once again support their 5K shirts with a $100 donation. He said that 
individuals and camps can also get their name on the shirts for $25. The SOS 
will donate $1 for each race entry to the Wilderness Healthcare Foundation. The 
motion was seconded by Karen R., to donate $100 to the SOS to sponsor t-shirts 
for this year’s 5-K event. Motion was carried.</p>

Boating Safety Course </b>Joe 
R. reported that he and Chuck Yartz will again offer the course locally if there 
is interest. No date has been established yet. If interested, people should 
contact him at 315-848-5326. Joe reviewed the laws pertaining to operation of 
motorized water craft in New York. All jet ski operators must take the course. 
Children must be at least 10 to operate a boat by themselves and at least 14 to 
operate a jet ski, assuming they have the boater safety certificate. Mike M. 
asked if the course included jet ski safety; Joe said “yes”. The course can 
also now be taken on-line. Information can be obtained from the SLPA web site (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://slpa.info/SLPA/slpa.info">slpa.info</a>)

</p>
<p>
<b>Suggested 
Projects, Speakers, Topics </b>
Deb<b> </b>B. suggested that we 
invite Arlene Davis to the August meeting to discuss invasives. Mike M. 
suggested that we invite members of the Trout Lake Association to our meetings 
and perhaps we could send some members to attend one of theirs to collaborate. 
Karen R. suggested that while not interested in beer, perhaps an alternative 
activity with the TLA might be to tour local wineries. Pam T. said that the 
wellness committee is looking for members. There will be a meeting in late 
July. Contact Pam for more info at 315-848-3476. </p>

Steve G. spoke of the 13<sup>th</sup> annual poker run on August 5<sup>th</sup>. 
He is looking for volunteers to shadow the planning and operation of the poker 
run this year so that eventually they will plan and run future poker runs. Bo 
said that this is indicative of perhaps a larger problem in the SLPA. A couple 
years ago, Mike and Mary Lou M. indicated that they would like to find 
replacement volunteers to do the water sampling. Fortunately, they are still 
willing to do what they do. Now, Steve is looking for help. Bo said that 
people have no idea how much time and energy it takes to put on the poker run, 
and that Chris, Steve and Tess have done this tirelessly every year since the 
beginning, with no complaints. Bo also commended Tess G. for her 25 years of 
service as treasurer (the group agreed and gave her a round of applauds). Of 
175 lake owners, only about 70 join the Association; only around 30 come to 
meetings; and only a very few members actually help to organize and run the 
Association. We need many more people to do a little more so that a few people 
can do a little less—a problem in many groups. Deb B. said that she would be 
willing to help with the Poker Run.</h1>
<h1 style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">

Another suggestion was made by Mike S.—he suggested that we create a tri-fold 
brochure that describes the SLPA, its purpose, activities, events, etc. for 
public relations purposes. </h1>

		<b><a name="August_27,_2016">August 27, 2016</a> Annual Dinner Meeting 
		at the Star Lake Haven</b></p>
		

<p><b><i>
Call to Order</i></b></p>
<p>
The meeting of 
the Star Lake Protective Association was called to order at 6:00 pm by President 
Vito T. after a cocktail hour at The Haven of Star Lake’s main lodge.</p>
<p>
Vito welcomed 
members and guests. Officers introduced themselves to the group. 40 members 
and guests attended.</p>
<p>
<b>Available 
Literature</b> Available 
for members was the latest <i>New York State Boaters’ Guide</i>. A number of 
brochures about invasive species were available. <i>Star Lake Handbooks</i> 
were also available for sale. </p>
<p>
<b>Wildlife 
Sightings</b> Chris C. has 
seen prickly lettuce plants on Scott’s Point, had pictures and said that the 
weeds could be pulled before flowering to stop further infestation. Mary Lou M. 
has researched the Canadian Geese problem; said that the DEC could be asked for 
help if the B. of water is used for drinking or for beach activities, which Star 
Lake is both. She said that the Water District person and/or town supervisor 
could be asked to contact the DEC. A (premature) discussion followed regarding 
the geese situation and what could be done about it. </p>
<p>
<b><i>
Approval of 
Minutes</i> </b>
Copies were available for member 
inspection. Vito entertained a motion to approve the minutes. John V. G. made 
a motion; seconded by Karen R., to approve the minutes of the June 25, 2016 
Regular Meeting as presented. There was no discussion; the motion was carried.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>
Treasurer’s Report</i>
</b>Tess G. gave the 
Treasurer’s Report. Beginning balance as of 6/25/16 was $7,655.21. Revenues 
were $790 from dues; $35 in donations from Denise B. (she donated her 3<sup>rd</sup> 
place poker run winnings); $5 from the sale of a <i>Star Lake Handbook</i>; and 
$354 from the Poker Run. Revenues totaled $1,184.00. Payments included $178.10 
reimbursement to Bo R. including $12.95 for latex gloves for road cleanups; 
$48.60 for a gift for the M.s; $24.45 for meeting costs and $92.10 for four ads 
in the <i>Bargain Hunter</i>. $100 was paid to Joe R. to sponsor the SOS 5-K 
walk/run t-shirts; and $104.36 was paid for June meeting refreshments. Total 
expenses were $382.46. The ending balance as of August 27<sup>th</sup>, 2016 is 
$8,456.75. </p>
<p>
John V. G. asked what we were 
doing with this money. Mike M. pointed out that if, in the future, we need to 
deal with an invasive species situation, our balance would be a drop in the 
bucket. Steve G. reminded the group of the tent caterpillar invasion a few 
years ago, when we hired experts for an egg population study. We need to be 
prepared for problems larger than the ones we deal with now. There were 69 
members to date not including those who paid at the meeting. Motion was made by 
Steve G., seconded by Karen R. to approve the treasurer’s report. The motion 
was carried.</p>

<b>Social 
Committee Report </b>
Daphne H., SLPA vice president and co-chair of the social committee, commented 
on this year’s social events. Daphne thanked Marty R. for her efforts in making 
the dinner arrangements for this meeting. She also thanked Steve G., Tess G. 
and Chris C. for their efforts each year organizing and running the poker run.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p> 
	<b>Lake Clean-ups</b> 
	Daphne said we had one of two Lake Road cleanups. She thanked the five 
	other participants and said that more help was needed. No one attended 
	breakfast.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p> 
	<b>Lake Shore Cleanup 
	</b>Steve G. and Chris C. were 
	the only ones to show up on the sandbar. They covered a large amount of 
	shoreline looking for cans, bottles, and other debris. Hopefully we can get 
	more people involved in this worthy activity next year. </p></li>
	<li>
	<p> 
	<b>Poker Run </b>
	Steve G. reported that the 12<sup>th</sup> 
	Annual Poker Run, held August 6<sup>th</sup>, was a great success. There 
	were 121 hands (32 less than last year’s record high) yielding $354 for the 
	treasury after $45 in expenses. Steve S. won first place with a full 
	house. Third place winner Denise B. donated her $35 prize back to the 
	SLPA. A great party followed! Marty R. pointed out that since Deb B. won 
	the prize for raft decoration, she had to pick the theme for next year’s 
	poker run. Deb said that the theme next year is “Cinco de August”. Vito 
	thanked Steve G., Chris C., Tess G., Bo R., and everyone else who helped to 
	organize and run the poker run this year and in the past. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>
Invasive 
Species Committee </b>
Dick R. 
gave some background regarding the committee (of 2) that was formed as a result 
of the June, 2016 meeting. He referred to a letter that he and Hank M. had 
composed with the intent to send it along with the spring mailing to all 
lakefront owners. He asked for SLPA approval to send the letter and informed 
the group that there have been no sightings of invasive water plant species yet; 
but, the letter was to inform owners of the potential threat to the lake and to 
ask their cooperation regarding the launching of watercrafts in the lake. Hank 
said that the letter is only a first step in an on-going effort to protect the 
lake environment. Many lakes have become infested with Milfoil and other weeds 
and we need to stop it before it starts. We need to educate/inform land owners 
of the threat. </p>
<p>

A 
discussion followed about the use of the word “require” in the letter. Vito and 
Lenny G. felt that many in the community would not be open to our “requiring” 
that those who use their property to launch watercraft wash and inspect their 
vessel before launch. Bo R. pointed out that that is the new law; that it is 
illegal to launch without inspecting (and cleaning) the boat, trailer, motor, 
gear, etc. Daphne said that there were many boats from other lakes launched by 
her property with no inspection. It was suggested that signage be placed where 
boats might be launched, including perhaps the Nice-n-Easy parking lot, where 
many boats gas up before launching. Other suggestions included talking to 
people who rent their camps out, to ask for their cooperation. Steve G. made a 
motion, seconded by Karen R., to authorize that the letter be sent, as is. 
Motion was carried. </p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt"><i>
<b>New Business</b></i></h1>
<p>
<b>Guest 
Speaker Sue Westbrook, Town of Fine Supervisor </b>
Sue said that things were 
generally “fine” in Fine. She spoke highly of three new council members who 
have added their talents to the Board. She said that the Town Board had 
unanimously agreed to accept the merger plans with the Town of Clifton. She 
commended the planning committee and DANC for doing a great job researching the 
proposed merger’s impact on the two towns. The Clifton Board recently rejected 
the plan, effectively putting an end to the process for now. The foot bridge 
project in Wanakena is going well, with its private funding campaign. Sue 
praised the highway department with its three new employees and its supervisor, 
Tracy Typher, who was elected from within. Regarding the Star Lake Water 
District project, Sue said that they are still looking for a viable water 
source, perhaps at the gravel pit on Lawrence Rd, owned by the Town. The 
construction of water mains should begin in the spring of 2017. She explained 
that water charges had to increase, in order to be eligible for various grants 
that support the project. Vito thanked Sue for speaking to our group. 
</p>
<p>
<b>National 
Loon Survey </b>Mike and 
Mary Lou M. have participated in a national loon survey coordinated by the 
Wilderness Society for the past several years. </p>
<p>
Mary Lou said 
that before she spoke of the survey, she wanted to share results so far of the 
State boat cleaning sites, per the discussion above regarding invasive species. 
She said that from May 27 to August 14, 36,349 boats had been inspected 
State-wide; and 1,235 were found to harbor invasives which were detected and 
removed from boats, prior to launch. 715 boats carried Eurasian milfoil; 250 
carried Curly-leaf pondweed; Zebra mussels hitch-hiked on 140 of the boats and 
109 carried variable leaf Milfoil (recently found in Cranberry Lake). Clearly, 
the boat wash sites are helping to protect our waters.</p>
<p>
Since 2001, the 
Wilderness Society saw a need for a loon survey. Now, 440 volunteers count 
loons on their waterways between 8 and 9 am on the specified date. Data is 
collected and given to researchers. There are over 2000 loons in the 
Adirondacks. 
Mike said that 
they counted on Star Lake four adults and one chick in 2016 and three adults and 
two chicks in 2015. For 
the year 2013, 85% of loons were adults; 13% were chicks and 2% were “immatures” 
or juveniles. Mike, at the end of the presentation, noted also that most recent 
sechi disk samples indicated water clarity to 21 feet—very clear, best results 
yet. </p>
<p>
Mike and Mary 
Lou have been sampling and testing Star Lake water in conjunction with ALAP 
(Adirondack Lake Assessment Program) since 2010. In appreciation for their 
continued efforts and dedication, Vito presented a certificate of appreciation 
to the M.s and a framed Jeanne Lampson print of a loon and chick. A hearty 
round of thankful applauds followed.</p>
<p>
<b>Canada Geese 
Problem </b>This 
discussion was a result of member Bob M.’s 8/20/16 e-mail to the SLPA: <i>“I 
bring to your attention that a large family of Canadian Geese in excess of 50 
are migrating on the sandbar after dusk for several hours. Please ask members 
and other boaters to not feed them or leave any food behind. Perhaps DEC should 
be consulted on ways to eradicate these birds before we have a problem. I bring 
to your attention that a Lake George beach is currently closed because of 
coliform bacteria, which is typically associated with fecal contamination that 
exceeds state health guidelines. The source of the bacteria could be a 
combination of any birds and mammals that frequent the area, including but not 
limited to ducks, gulls, dogs, humans and other sources like septic tanks. 
Another beach on Saratoga Lake was closed for two weeks in July because of E. 
coli, another bacteria associated with fecal contamination. I bring this to 
your attention in hopes SLPA could take the matter under consideration and take 
steps now to eradicate these birds off the lake.”</i> </p>
<p>

This 
problem is becoming more of a priority to the SLPA, not only from a health 
standpoint; but also, geese are a great nuisance, defecating on lawns around the 
lake, the school and the golf course and destroying vegetable gardens and 
blueberries. Prior to five years ago, geese used to just pass through the area 
in the spring and fall. Now, they are reproducing on the lake, causing far more 
damage to property and to the lake itself. The SLPA tests for coliforms and 
will specifically test the sandbar again this year. Sue Westbrook said that she 
would discuss the problem with Mark Hall, Water District Supervisor, who also 
has good connections with the Area 6 DEC people. Geese, while federally 
protected, have outgrown their target population and are causing problems 
everywhere. We will continue to monitor the problem and seek legal solutions.</p>
<p>
<b>2017 
Proposed Calendar </b>No 
objections to the proposed dates were made, so, by motion of Pam T.; second by 
Mike B., the proposed dates listed on the agenda will stand for 2017. </p>
<p>
<b>
2017 
Membership Dues </b>Tess 
G. indicated that the current level of dues at $20 for regular membership and 
$10 for associate membership is adequate for maintaining a healthy balance in 
the treasury and that they need not be changed. A motion by Tess G., seconded 
by Steve G. to not change member dues was passed and dues shall remain at 
current levels.<b> </b></p>
<p>
<b>
Election of 
Officers for 2017 </b>
Steve G., 
as our de facto nominating committee of one, suggested a 2017 slate comprised of 
current 2016 officers of Vito T. for president; Daphne H. for vice president; 
and Bo R. for secretary. Steve said that Tess G. had been treasurer since 1993 
and would like to retire this year. Steve spoke of Chris C.’s qualifications 
and nominated her for the position of treasurer. He asked if there were any 
nominations from the floor. There were none, so Steve made the motion, seconded 
by Karen R., for the secretary to cast one ballot to elect the proposed slate of 
officers for 2017. Motion to accept the slate as presented was carried. The 
group gave Tess a standing ovation for a job well-done and well-appreciated.

		Adirondack Exhibit Center</b></p>
		

		<p><b><i>
		Call to 
		Order</i></b></p>
<p>
The meeting was 
called to order 10:05 am by Vito T., president. President Vito thanked the 
social committee for refreshments, supplied by Coffee Fever. The officers were 
introduced. Current officers are: Vito T., president; Daphne H., 
vice-president; Tess G., treasurer; and Bo R., secretary. Attendees introduced 
themselves. 21 were in attendance. </p>
<p>
<b>Good/Bad 
Wildlife Sightings: </b>Feets 
S. said there was a loon nest on a nearby island. Vito said he thought he saw a 
single baby loon off the nest, riding on a parent’s back. Raymond C. said he 
taped 8 loons’ calls; and they respond to playbacks. </p>
<p>
<b>Literature 
Available:</b> Vito told 
members that copies of the current <i>New York Boaters’ Guide</i> and the <i>
Federal Requirements &amp; Safety Tips for Recreational Boats</i> were available for 
the taking. Bo R. pointed out that he had acquired literature from the APIPP 
(Adirondack Park Invasive Plants Program); and invasive species information was 
also on the table for the taking. Bo encouraged members to read and share the 
literature with other lake users. Hank M. spoke of a lake he had recently 
visited that was invaded by milfoil—said it was a horrendous problem getting 
through the weeds with a boat. A (premature) discussion followed about 
invasives and what can be done. Bo said that it is a very important mission of 
the SLPA to protect the lake and its environment and suggested a standing Water 
Quality committee be created to oversee water testing and invasive species 
education and vigilance. Richard R. and Hank M. volunteered. It was suggested 
that the committee should have a budget to operate with, to reimburse members 
for travel expenses, etc. Richard R. made a motion to authorize $300 for the 
committee. Steve G. amended the motion, seconded by John B., to authorize up to 
$500 to reimburse committee expenses. The motion was carried. Discussion 
followed about what could be done about invasives. Suggestions were made, such 
as <i>Bargain Hunter</i> ads seeking lake owner and public cooperation and 
signage at potential boat launch sites including the public carry-on site. Vito 
brought the meeting back to the agenda and said that there was room for further 
discussion later in the agenda. </p>
<p>
<b>Approval of 
Minutes:</b> Minutes to 
the August 29, 2015 meeting were available for discussion. A motion was made by 
Debby B., seconded by Karen R., to approve the minutes of the August 29, 2015 
annual meeting as presented. Motion was carried. </p>
<p>
<b>Treasurer’s Report:

<b>Social Committee Report</b>—Vito 
thanked the social committee for their efforts in planning and organizing the 
dinner and other events. The committee is comprised of Daphne H., Trudy C., 
Mary R., Pam T. and Karen R.. Daphne discussed 2016 SLPA events:</p>
<p> 
<b>Dinner Meeting </b>
Plans for the<b> </b>annual dinner 
meeting are almost finalized. Daphne passed around pre-registration cards for 
the dinner, which will be at the Haven at Star Lake once again this year on 
August 27<sup>th</sup>. Watch the <i>Bargain Hunter</i> for details. <b></b></p>
<p> 
<b>Poker Run </b>
August 6<sup>th</sup> There was 
some discussion about changing the date; but, it was decided that changing it 
would cause more conflicts than leaving it the 6<sup>th</sup>. People will 
register at the sandbar as in the past; their registration (per hand) will be 
verified by the stations and the hand will be determined later at the sandbar.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Lake Road Cleanups </b>
Daphne passed around a sign-up 
sheet for the two cleanups which will be held on Wednesday, July 13<sup>th</sup> 
and Wednesday, September 7<sup>th</sup>. Dates were changed to Wednesdays to 
avoid weekend conflicts. We will meet at the school parking lot at 9 am sharp. 
Vito thanked those who signed up in the past and noted that the SLPA bought 
breakfast after the cleanup for the volunteers. </p>
<p> 
<b>Lake Shore Cleanup </b>
The shoreline cleanup last year 
yielded many cans, bottles, other debris and a tire. Only four crafts divided 
up the shoreline—a rather small group of volunteers. This year, we will hold 
another lake shore cleanup, to be held Wednesday, August 17<sup>th</sup>. 
Volunteers will meet at the sandbar at 1 pm where we will decide what shoreline 
areas each will cover. A signup sheet was circulated. <i>(Secretary’s note: the 
same few people signed up again this year!)</i></p>
<p>
><b>Benson Mines 
Tour</b> – Our “thanks” to 
George P., who will once again offer a tour of the old Benson Mines property and 
its recent commercial venture into crushed granite production. Feets S. said he 
took the tour with George and it was very interesting. He recommends it to all. 
The tour will begin at George’s gravel pit on Route 3, across from the post 
office at 10:00 am on July 16<sup>th </sup>(rain date July 17<sup>th</sup>). A 
sign-up sheet was circulated. Joe R. added that the Adirondack Exhibit Center 
is hosting a Railroad Open House at 1:30 on July 2<sup>nd</sup>. George P. will 
be there to discuss the granite operation and the role the newly-renovated rail 
service will play in transporting crushed granite. </p>

<b>Old Business</b></i></p>
<p>
<b>SLPA Website 
Update </b>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">– Bo R.said that the SLPA web site at


<a style="font-family: Verdana" href="http://www.slpa.info/">www.slpa.info</a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
has been up for over nine years, since March, 2007. Bo reported that the 2016 
username and password for the members’ area are in the agenda. There was a 
question about when the username/password was needed. Bo explained that it is 
only for the “members’ area” of the web site, in order to protect the privacy of 
members who had originally expressed concern. There is a great deal of content 
available to those who go to the public area of the site. Some members said 
that they access the site frequently, particularly during the winter months and 
like the pictures. </p>
		

		

		<p>
<b>Problems 
		with DEC Carry-on Access </b>
		People are still abusing 
		the DEC site. Garbage, partying, and swimming have been observed by 
		lake neighbors. Sara W., owner of the old Lakeview property (which 
		adjoins the carry-on site), said that they have had several padlocks cut 
		off their gate and there has been considerable public use of their 
		property and the boat launch site property as well. Bo said that people 
		should report abuse as it happens to the DEC or State Police (phone 
		numbers are included on the agenda).</p>
<p> <i>
<b>New Business</b></i></p>
<p>
<b>Nominating 
Committee </b>Vito asked 
Steve G. if he would seek nominations for the election of 2017 officers, to be 
held at the annual dinner meeting. Steve agreed.</p>
<p> <b>
Need for Water Quality Committee
</b>Bo R. pointed out 
(again) the need for our Association to be proactive and get involved with water 
testing and invasive species monitoring to “preserve and protect the lake” (<i>see 
discussion above</i>). </p>
<p> <b>
Water Testing Results</b> 
Bo spoke, in the absence of Mike and Mary Lou M., of Star Lake water quality 
test results summarized on the back of the agenda. The full ALAP report can be 
found at on the ALAP site <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.protectadks.org/programs/lake-assessment-alap/">http://www.protectadks.org/programs/lake-assessment-alap/</a> 
(<i>follow link to “what lakes are assessed” and select “Star Lake”</i>). 
According to the report, the lake is in very good shape.</p>
<p>
Bo reminded the 
group of the tireless, on-going contributions made by members Mike and Mary Lou, 
who have conducted water sampling for the Adirondack Lake Assessment Program (ALAP) 
since 2010. Water samples were taken three times each summer with sampling 
equipment reimbursed by the SLPA. Samples were then taken to the lab at Paul 
S.’s in Saranac Lake for analysis. In addition to ALAP testing, the M.s 
have also, for the past three years, tested for fecal coliform. Bo noted that 
this is particularly of merit since the coliform water samples had to be 
transported to a lab within hours after the samples were taken. While the SLPA 
has reimbursed the Mike and Mary Lou for ALAP and Coliform lab costs, traveling 
expenses have not been asked for or reimbursed and the time they donated is 
immeasurable. Bo said that they had indicated that perhaps this summer might be 
the last year that they would do the water testing/sampling. Bo asked who in 
the group would be willing to contribute so thanklessly. Much discussion 
followed and the group commented with great appreciation for the M.s’ 
contribution to the lake. A motion was made by Richard R., seconded by John B., 
for the secretary to send a note of appreciation to Mike and Mary Lou for their 
efforts, along with a $50 gift certificate. Motion was carried. Deb B. made a 
motion, seconded by John B., to add the $200 cost of coliform testing to the 
Water Quality committee budget as an on-going commitment. Motion was carried, 
bringing the budget to $700 per year. </p>
<p>
<b>Adirondack 
Exhibit Center Funding Request </b>
Joe R. thanked the SLPA for having 
our meeting at the Adirondack Exhibit Center. Joe asked that the SLPA once 
again support their 5K shirts with a $100 donation. He said that individuals 
and camps can also get their name on the shirts for $25. The SOS will donate 
part of the proceeds of the race to the local food pantry. The SOS committee is 
funded by contributions and revenues from the 5K walk/run race, and the pie 
social, raffle and auction that follow the race. Steve G. made a motion, 
seconded by Deb B., to donate $100 to the SOS to sponsor t-shirts for this 
year’s 5-K event. Motion was carried.</p>
<p>
<b>Boating 
Safety Course </b>Joe R. 
reported that two people had signed up for the Boating Safety Course this year. 
The course can now be taken on-line. Information can be obtained from the
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.slpa.info/">
SLPA web site</a> or you can go to the
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.parks.ny.gov/recreation/boating/boating-safety-class.aspx">
NYS boater safety site</a>. Joe reviewed the laws pertaining to operation of 
motorized water craft in New York. Joe said that New York State passed a new 
law whereby those born after May 1, 1996 (20 and younger) must have the 8-hour 
boaters’ safety course certificate in order to operate any motorized boat. 
Those born before that date are grandfathered. ALL jet ski operators must take 
the course. Children must be at least 10 to operate a boat by themselves and at 
least 14 to operate a jet ski, assuming they have the boater safety certificate.</p>
<p>
<b>Suggested 
Projects, Speakers, Topics </b>
Discussion followed. Jan M. asked 
about the progress of the water district project. Chris C. had gone to the Town 
meeting; said that test wells near the golf course have been unproductive so 
far. Town officials said we are in an “invisible period” where there is a lot 
being accomplished behind the scenes. It was agreed by the group to invite Mark 
Hall, former Town Supervisor and Water District supervisor, to the August 
meeting to speak of the progress of the project. 
It was also 
suggested that Sue Westbrook, current Town of Fine Supervisor, and the C-F 
Hospital administrator might be good guest speakers in the future. </p>
<p> <i>
<b>
Other Business</b> 
-
</i>
Raymond C. suggested Poker Run tee shirts. Pam T. reminded the group of the C-F 
Hospital celebration on August 20th. John B. told the group about the 
Hospital’s Weight Watchers program. No action was taken. </p>
<p> <i>
<b>
Adjournment</b> </i>
Motion was made to adjourn by Feets S.; seconded by Steve G.. Motion was 
carried and the meeting was adjourned at 11:27 am.</p>
