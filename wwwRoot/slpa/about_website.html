		<h2><b>A Little About the History of This Web Site...</b></h2>

		<h3>
			At the August, 2005 meeting of the SLPA,Bo Ritchings asked if there was any interest in
			establishing an Association web site. If so, he would volunteer to begin
			the project over the winter months.
			During discussion that ensued, it was noted that:
		</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>The SLPA website could provide a means for better communication
				among members of the SLPA and Star Lake community;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The web site and e-mail accounts could also reduce postage and
				office expenses, since fewer paper mailings would be necessary;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The site would provide a great way to
				preserve the SLPA archives which include meeting minutes dating back
				over a hundred years to
				the creation of the Association (archives are currently in paper form; one copy only exists);</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>It might assist in the
				promotion of the lake;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>It could potentially be useful to people with rental cottages and businesses; </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>It could be a positive attribute of the
				community to be noted in grant applications and economic development;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Most important, it could provide a glimpse into
				the history of Star Lake and its only Association.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A motion passed unanimously to authorize up to $200 for the purpose of starting and maintaining an SLPA website.&nbsp; Bo agreed to make it a winter
		project, time permitting.&nbsp; Thus began the journey that would get us where we are today, March 12, 2007, the day of the site launching.&nbsp;
		Work progressed slowly throughout the winter.&nbsp;At the July, 2006 meeting, Bo reportedthat a site was created using Microsoft FrontPage 2003.&nbsp;
		So far, we have :</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>A home page with table of upcoming events and an intro to the SLPA; </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A password protected "members only" area to address some members' need for privacy;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>An archives area (within the member area) for the By Laws, past minutes and historical information;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A links page pointing to various resources of interest to members;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Links to the <i>Star Lake Handbook</i> in Adobe .pdf format for viewing; </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A photo gallery with some favorite pictures of Star Lake; </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A feedback form so that viewers of the site could react to the site or communicate with the SLPA.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Bo noted that he should <i>not</i> be solely responsible for all the content of the site; that volunteers could
	and should submit information. He suggested some topics that might interest
	members and asked for volunteers to work on those topics.&nbsp; He said that this is a
	great opportunity for some older members to preserve forever, their "reflections"
	on Star Lake.&nbsp; First-person narratives about "Star Lake when I first came
	here" would be great reading, as many of our senior members have a rich history
	with the lake.&nbsp; </p>

	<p>
	At the August, 2006 meeting, Bo reported that some new pages have been assembled and the web site is progressing nicely.&nbsp;
	A "most recent minutes" page has been added, as has a page dealing with unwritten rules of the lake for newcomers.&nbsp; He is
	shopping for a web host service that will meet our needs, be economical and
	offer additional services that might be useful to members, such as free
	e-mail accounts.&nbsp; Bo again said that he would maintain the site; but
	would not be responsible for generating all the content for the site.&nbsp;
	Help was again sought from volunteers to research and create content.&nbsp; Suggested topics include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The Microburst of 1995,
			event and pictures;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Memories of youth on Star Lake,
			narrative;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A history of the Star Lake Regatta, narrative and pictures;&nbsp; </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>"Rafting on Star Lake," history, pictures, <i>Adirondack Life</i> article;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>A summer rentals section with descriptions, pictures, and reservation info;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>An old Star Lake postcard gallery (many members have collections to share)</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

		<p>Bo said he would hopefully have the site up some time this winter.</p>

		<!--LUNAR PAGES HOSTING -->
		<h3>	<b>SLPA hosted by </b>	<a href="http://www.lunarpages.com/id/SLPAinfo">	<img src="index_files/lunarpages.gif" border="0" width="150" height="40">	</a>	</h3>
		<p>The site continued to be refined and a web host was selected.&nbsp; As of March, 2007, the site
		was ready to launch for the first time!&nbsp; We are officially the owners of
		the domain name <a href="http://www.slpa.info/">"SLPA.info"</a>.&nbsp; After
		extensive shopping for and reading reviews of (it seemed like) hundreds of web
		hosting services, Lunarpages was finally selected to host the site.&nbsp; They
		were carefully selected for a number of very good reasons:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<div>
				<p>
				Lunarpages Web Hosting is the #1 rated, affordable web
				hosting service for uptime, customer support, and feature-rich hosting.
				</p>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			They provide a huge amount of server space--1,500 GB with 15,000 GB of bandwidth per month.&nbsp; While we probably
			won't have that much traffic, we will need lots of storage as we continue to
			add to the site and archives.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>They  domain transfers for only $7.95, private domain registration, and a FREE domain
			name for the life of the hosting plan. Additional domain names are also only
			$7.95 each.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>They provide for free $700 worth of
			"Coffee Cup" webmaster-and-design
			>software and other server-based features, including
			the FrontPage extensions necessary to help develop and maintain our web site.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>They provide unlimited POP-3 and
			SMTP based e-mail accounts, which can be used by our members.&nbsp; Many of our
			"snowbirds" will appreciate the "web-based" access to their e-mail, for when
			they travel south.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Lunarpages seems to rule in the
			customer service area.&nbsp; Based on user reviews and my own experiences, they are
			simply "the best".&nbsp; They provide 24/7 award-winning
			support services by >e-mail or toll-free phone
			support, and they maintain a member forum to help solve problems.&nbsp; Coffee
			Cup Software also provides great support from their
			<a href="http://www.lunarpages.com/free-web-design-software.php">Coffee Cup Site</a>.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Their price is extremely attractive.&nbsp;
			By purchasing a two-year contract and by taking advantage of a coupon offer, we
			were able to get <b>26 months</b> of hosting for just <b>$149.75 </b>which is
			well within our startup budget.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's just $5.76 a month for the
			first 26 months.&nbsp; After that, it will cost around $7.00 per month.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Another great feature is that,
			through an affiliate program, if someone signs up for a Lunarpages account by
			using our <a href="http://www.lunarpages.com/id/SLPAinfo">affiliate link to
			their site</a>, the SLPA will receive a commission of $65 to help defray our
			future costs.&nbsp; Always looking for no/low-cost projects, it's possible that
			our web site might become self-sustaining or even generate some revenue--time
			will tell.&nbsp; </p>
