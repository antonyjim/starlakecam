		<b>History of the <i>Star Lake Handbook</i> </b>

		<p>The first Star Lake Handbook was created
		and printed in 1995. John Sayles did most of the research and writing
		while Roy Djuvik created the map and lot data to identify who lived
		where. Peter Kress aided in the printing and the Handbook was distributed to Star
		Lake Protective Association members and others who expressed an
		interest. The <a href="http://slpa.info/SLHandbook/SLHandbook95Letter.pdf">cover letter</a>
		that was distributed with the 1995 <i>Handbook</i> describes the original objectives of the <i>Handbook</i>: "to provide information
		about our lake; to promote understanding and tolerance for the varied
		uses and pleasures the lake provides each of us; and to encourage
		protection and wise use of the lake."</p>
		<p>An increasing number of requests for a revised Handbook finally led to the
		second edition in 2004, reprinted in 2005. Roy, Peter and John spent countless hours
		originating and publishing the first Handbook and it is out of respect for their efforts that I have
		made my contributions. Much of the original text remains while other sections were edited and updated in the second edition. The map was
		improved and the lake owner directories were updated to reflect new owners. Color photos and charts were added and the fish stocking
		program was brought up-to-date. The fish spotters guide was completely revamped with color photos and descriptions of more fish found in Star
		Lake. Existing sections were expanded and a new section seeking harmony within the lake community was added. Desktop publishing software
		provided a professional look while condensing more information into a smaller package. In 2009, we ran out of copies of the
		Handbook and reprinting became necessary. Much of the information was outdated. A new cover was
		designed. Owner data and the fish stocking program were updated. Other
		minor edits and revisions were made to bring us to this 2009 edition.
		</p>
		<p>I, too, have spent countless hours on
		this project over the past five or six years; but it was a labor of love
		devoted to the most wonderful lake in the world! I hope you enjoy the
		2009
		Star Lake Handbook in its
		revised but hopefully not final edition. Bo Ritchings
