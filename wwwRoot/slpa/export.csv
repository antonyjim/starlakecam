Customer unable to add more vehicles to a specific account.  Account is sitting at maximum allowable entries: 999. The renumbering program that runs during maintenance after vehicles are deleted will not run successfully if there are more than 800 vehicles on the account.  You can confirm this by checking logfile for the error message.

*** 1). Confirm the customer's number of vehicles is >800:
SQL> select count(*) from vhistory where vhcust ='XXXXX';     ? (where XXXXX = 5-digit customer #)

If the number returned is under 800, this may not be the problem, but complete step 2, then skip to step 4. If they still cannot add a vehicle after step 4, open a ticket to Support.

*** 2). Discuss with the caller and determine what retention period to use for this customer:
SQL> select lcvnum from loccntl;     ? (to see how long location is keeping vehicle history for all customers - display is in months)

Advise the caller of their current retention period. They can either:
1) They can set a shorter retention period for this specific customer by setting the retention period in Veh Hist Ovr (Vehicle History Override) field on the Customer/Vehicle Maintenance screen (CVMNT). The field value is # of months; see note below about Retail A/R customers.
2) Reduce their retention period for all customers on the last page of their Location Profile screen (PROF). The field value is # of months.

* They -must- do one of the preceeding two things before proceeding to step 3.

* NOTE *:  GASC/JT Retail Stores cannot change this for A/R customers.  If the customer is an A/R account, you will need to change it for them as follows:
SQL> update custmast set cmveh_ret_ovr = 'xxx' where cmcust = 'xxxxx';     ? (you must enter the leading zeros in both fields)
SQL> commit;

*** 3). Run the vehicle history deletion program:
In smenu, go to option 9 (Utilities menu), option 6 (runpgm) to run maintenance vehicle history deletion program as shown:

type: MNTVHSTD (press enter ? must be caps)
(you can use !tail /logfile in plus when completed to see deletion counts)

Check counts in plus again at this point.
SQL> select count(*) from vhistory where vhcust ='XXXXX';

So long as this number is under 800, you can move to step 3. Otherwise, you will need to change the retention period again and repeat.

*** 4). Run the vehicle renumbering program:
In smenu, go to option 9 Utilities Menu, option 6 to run maintenance vehicle history deletion program as shown:

type: MNTVRNUM (press enter ? must be caps)

Once this renumbering completes, sign back into plus to check customer veh count in custmast and vhistory:

SQL> select count(*) from vhistory where vhcust ='XXXXX';     ? This shows the # of vehicles.
SQL> select cmvehs from custmast where cmcust ='XXXXX';     ? This shows the highest numbered vehicle.

Payment applied to the wrong a/r account.  Need to apply to the correct account.""","There are 3 steps to this process.
If you need to give the customer a receipt or the customer originally paid with cash use the Cash/Check Receipt option. If you do not need a receipt and the customer paid by check in the mail, use the Mastercheck option.

1. On the payment screen for the A/R account the money was originally applied to, type in a negative check or cash amount (depending on how the customer originally paid) as entered on the original cash receipt.
Type in a negative payment amount as entered on the original cash receipt. Press enter.
A message """"Correction has been processed"""" will display. Press F7 Save/Print.
This creates a positive line item on the account.

2. Now you need to clear the line item you just created.
Go back into the same A/R account. On the payment screen, press enter and the cursor goes to line# field.
Find the line the money was originally applied to.
The line will most likely be in closed items (F4) or on the current open item screen. It could also be in the App Amt field, if the original payment was never applied to a line item (If this is true just enter the line # created by step 1 and press F2 Pay by Line. Then print the receipt and go to step 3).
Type in the line number and a negative amount (original receipt amount) to bring the line items back to the original balance.  Press enter.
This will put the amount in the App Amt field. Do this to all lines that were paid in error. The amount in APP Amt should match the line we created on the negative doc.
Find the line item created by step 1 above.  Type in the line number and press F2 Pay by Line.
This line should now show a zero balance. Press F7 Save/Print.

3. Now bring up the account the payment should have been applied to and process a normal payment receipt.
NOTE: If a closed item was opened up in step 2 it will not show as an open item until the receipt is printed or saved and the account is accessed again.

Complete details here:

file://akrshare01/share/nat/GBMS\CLIENT\GBMS%20Support\DOCUMENTATION\Employee%20New%20Vehicle%20Tire%20Changeovers.pdf

Eligibility
Goodyear employees, retirees, and their eligible dependents are all eligible for Employee changeovers. Eligible dependents are defined as family members who qualify as dependents under the Medical Benefit program.

Process
All changeover tires will be brought into inventory as code 669?950?950.
The work order is constructed the same way as you would normally generate one. However, on the ?Merchandise Verify? screen, the tire quantity of the tires you are bringing into inventory will be a minus (-), enter an E in the Billing Code field, and use product code 669?950?950. Change the selling price to equal the price of the outgoing tire. For example:
Product Code 	Bill Code 	QTY. 		Description 							Amount
413-111-111 		R 						4 			P205/65R15 Comfortred 		$100.00
669-950-950 		E 						(4) 		Changeover 							($100.00)

***Important Note***
On the DSA the loss on the Employee Changeover tire will be offset by the gain of the replacement Goodyear tire. This is now an automated process; no additional actions are required by the store associate.

Selling Changeovers
All changeovers (code 669?950-950) are costed at $10.00 per tire with a default selling price of $12.50.
Best practice would be to change the selling price to a higher amount. The higher the selling price, the more gross margin dollars a store can make.
Example:
If a store sells a set of changeovers for $75.00 per tire, they would make $260.00 in gross margin plus any tire related services.

***Approval numbers are NOT needed***
**Since the changeover code is quite generic, it is recommended that stores keep a sheet with the changeover detail near the register. This list would show the sizes and brands in inventory.

There are two things you can do to get ready for Tire-HQ:
1) install a current browser on your pc and
2) set up bookmarks to the new site.
Current browser downloads can be downloaded from the Tire-HQ login page (at the bottom)

1. Tire-HQ is built to utilize features available in current browsers. If you continue using Netscape 4.x on Tire-HQ, you will be missing out: the website will look just like XPLOR does currently. Using a current browser gets you access to all the enhanced features of Tire-HQ. This also means that because of the current configuration of GBMS, those users will only see the site as it is today.

      A current browser means you are using Netscape version 7.01 or higher, or Internet Explorer version 5.5 service pack 2 or higher. You can view information and instructions on a current version of Internet Explorer at www.microsoft.com/ie. Using Internet Explorer means you don't need to download a new version of Netscape, but if you wish to continue using Netscape, you can find the newest version at www.netscape.com/browsers. Netscape 7 should not be installed to the same directory as Netscape 4. This will allow you to continue using Netscape 4.x to access XPLOR until Tire-HQ is available for you to use in April.
(To find out the version of Microsoft Internet Explorer ... launch IE, click on """"Help"""", then about Internet Explorer)

2. You should create a new bookmark to Tire-HQ. Use http://www.tire-hq.com as the url. While you are in your bookmarks, make sure that your bookmark for XPLOR is set to http://xplor.goodyear.com. Make sure you bookmark for XPLOR is no longer than that, as having extra words in the bookmark will cause a problem for getting to the new Tire-HQ website."""

* Communications Down or Unstable: CP3923","1.  Is location on the R7954000 GBMS Daily Transmission Report? Is the location on the Out Of Balance Conditions notification?
If yes to either, and the caller is looking for overnight reports, note report accordingly and forward to Interface. Otherwise, if yes, advise that stats will be updated upon the next successful transmission processing and proceed to troubleshoot overnight communications issues if present. If no, proceed to step 2A for missing stats and 2B for overnight reports.

*** INTERFACE: Send down transmission and proceed from step 3.

2.  SMENU, Opt. 5 - List /u/dsxvol
* A (missing stats): Take note of the time indicated next to the BKUP file from yesterday's day. Go into plus and use command ""@seeb50"". Check the list of recent cutoffs and make sure one was created yesterday. If the time of yesterday's B50 cutoff is later than the BKUP file time, then they did not perform the cutoff in time for data to be received. System pulls data about one hour after the closing time for that day according to the location's profile (PROF) screen. Changes to location profile will not take effect for transmissions until the day after the next successful B50/EODCO and transmission. Note what happened, advise the caller, and close report.

* B (overnight reports): If there are files present there with the suffix .GZ, go to step 3.
If no files listed there, they may be queued to print and held, or were printed and lost. Check the printer settings for overnight printing on the homepage, make sure it is enabled. If the printer is not working, check the queue of the printer set for overnight printing (SMENU, Opt 7, Opt. 3). If held print jobs are not found, check Akron Reports in the Reports menu on the homepage to reprint. If still not found, or if this is a persistent issue, note the issue and forward to Support.

3.  Opt. 9 - Utilities Menu, Opt. 11 Mntunzip
This will uncompress the files in dsxvol with the suffix .GZ

4.  Opt 6 - Run a utility/ mnt program (runpgm) and type: mntupdt
You will see mnt programs running across the screen.  Once complete, hit enter.

Please be advised that the following changes SHOULD be on your GBMS System effective 09/27/07:

  For locations on TRIAD:
In Point Of Sale, Delivery Receipt & Customer Vehicle Management we have added TPMS Vehicle reference when a vehicle is selected that is equipped with a """"Tire Pressure
Monitoring System (TPMS)"""". After selecting a vehicle you will receive """"pop-up""""  notification informing you that the vehicle is TPMS equipped or the TPMS Status for this vehicle is unknown. This is so that you and the Technician working on the vehicle are aware that a special tool may be required when dismounting/mounting tires from this vehicle. A printed notice will also appear on the work orders for both D/R and POS but ONLY for those vehicles equipped with TPMS.

  To activate the TPMS function you need to update the TPMS indicator in your location profile.   There is a new indicator on the second screen entitled TPMS. This will initially be set to """"N"""". If you choose to use the TPMS notification simply change this indicator to """"Y"""" and then activate TPMS in TRIAD via the steps outlined below.

  You must follow the steps below in order for TPMS to be read properly. If you do not activate TPMS in TRIAD any vehicle selected will display TPMS STATUS UNKNOWN.

To Activate TPMS in TRIAD:
  From the Main Menu:
1. Access Product Administration.
2. From the Product Administration menu select Triad Maintenance.
3. From the Triad Maintenance screen select option 2 Manufacturer Line Code Setup.
4. Select line 1 Activant Information (press Enter).
5. Page down until Tire Pressure Monitoring System is displayed. Should be line 36.
6. Type in that line in the Coverage field, press tab to Your Line field and type TPM.
7. Press F6 Add.
8. Pres ESC /ESC twice until the prompt Save Your Changes Y/N appears. Answer Y.
    System will return back to the Triad Maintenance screen.
9. Answer Y  to the prompt """"Do You Want to Backup Your Manufacturer Setup File To
    Akron"""".
10. Exit Point Of Sale, Delivery Receipts and Triad from ALL terminals. Then when you
   access these programs again TPMS will print the correct message based on TRIAD
   information.

  If you choose not to activate TPMS you will not see any change in the way your vehicle
is currently validated.

3rd level support is currently looking into this problem.  Advise & close.","3rd level support is currently looking into this problem.

Each user is only allowed to look at certain documents localized to their group.

IE:  Dealer are only allowed to look at dealer documents.  NA is only allowed to look at NA documents, Canadian docs are only for Canada, US for US, etc.

Also, some documents are open for every one.  IE: New products, etc.

The problem is that the site search is displaying all documents relating to the search that was preformed.  This means that US documents are being displayed to Canadian dealers, NA documents are being displayed dealers, etc.  When the user tries to go into the document, it says that they are not authorized to view the document.  This is because they are trying to click on a document that they are not supposed to be able to get in.

Until this problem is rectified, you will need to try to recreate the problem here.  Once the document opens for you, you will see if it's a document that they are supposed to get into or if it's not for them. If you look at the document and it's not obvious (US vs. Canadian document) then you can just tell them that the document is not one they are suppose to view and it wasn't suppose to display for them.  (Security permissions for the document still apply.)

Note: Canadian Document usually have Susan Whalen's name next to the document name."

It could be due to a lack of pricing available from the WD, but as products are added, the prices will be dynamically generated based on the setting."" shows up, the WD needs to set pricing levels for the user.

To see if a user is setup with Price levels, goto: GBMS > Main Menu > Administration (ADM) > Cust/Vehicle Management (CVMGT) > Cust/Vehicle Maintenance (CVMNT) > Option 1) Add/Revise Cust Information.  WD will enter in the name of the dealer.  Customer number will be in the upper left hand side. Price level will be in the center at the bottom.

WTC - GBMS Tip:
***************************************

Enter in the price level that was found in CVMNT to view that level.","When pricing does not appear in goodyearwholesale.com, check the user name. The user name may have a nonsig associate with it.

Put that nonsig in WAD and view page 50. At the bottom of the page, you will see a GX section. If any of these are marked, then the user is a G3X and should show pricing. If none of these are marked, then the dealer is a G110.  G3X gets pricing from goodyearwholesale.com. G110 buys directly from Goodyear and gets Goodyear pricing. G110 are usually large companies that do a lot of volume.

If they are a G3X and they still do not have pricing, get the following information:
User Name for goodyearwholesale.com
Name of dealer
WD/WTC's NonSig

Write it up and send it to 2nd level.

For example, the manufacturer or mfc "".XX"" is NOT a manufacturer found in the triad parts catalog.

The user will need to make the effort to receipt in parts under the proper mfc/ partno that is contained in the triad parts catalog in order to have core values retained on parts with a quantity on hand greater than zero.

If in doubt, you can get the mfc/ partno of the part in question from the user and look it up in the triad parts catalog on the appropriate test system near your workstation.  If it is found, it is a triad part, if not, well, it is NOT a triad part.

A1.  This change is required due to security policy requirements and a new software upgrade on Tire-HQ.  It was a business decision.  It is mandatory to make the site a more secure site.

Q2.  We all share the same username here, now what do we do?
A2.  Have the user admin setup each person with their own username & password.   Since orders are identified by username, this could be important with identifing who is ordering tires at your location.

Q3.  What if employees come & go all the time, and setting up usernames all the time would be a hassle?
A3.  Generic usernames eg. mylocc01, mylocc02, mylocc03 can be established for several users at your location.  As employees leave, passwords will need to be modified.  Valid email addresses need to updated, so password resets can be automaticly administrated on ""Reset Password"" application.  We do not reccomend that this solution be used (see answer to #1)

Q4.  I don't know who the user administrator is for my location?
A4.  The user administator should be listed in the new announcement note on Tire-HQ.  If that person no longer works there, have the owner/manager call us to have this change made.  If needed, look up user administrator in User Registration database, view ""Dealers by Common Owner/Customer view"" (top item).

Q5.  I am the administrator.  How do I create/edit another user.
A5.  The administrator would need to go to ""User Administration"" located on the home page under site controls.  A pdf file is supplied below.  This file can be e-mailed to that person for instructions on setting up and editing a new or existing user."

In this case, it is possible for the location to change the paper type back in the menus but difficult to explain over the phone.  Instead, follow these instructions:

1. Remote into the location using PLUS.  When it asks if you want to run smenu, enter N.  At the command prompt, enter ""lpstat -s"" and look for the IP address of the laser which is having this problem.  Once found and copied, type exit to log out.

2. Open up your web browser and paste or type in the IP address for the printer on the URL line.

3. On the printer's main page, the paper types for tray 1 and tray 2 are listed.  Tray 1 should be any size/any type, and tray 2 should be SIZE - LETTER / TYPE - PLAIN.  If the settings are not correct, go to the Settings tab and Configure Device.

4. From this menu, click ""PAPER HANDLING.""

5. Tray 1 and tray 2 paper settings should be Tray 1 - any size, any type; Tray 2 - letter, plain. If they are not, make the change and click Apply.

After applying, check to make sure the change took, and then reset print services (see CP1795) or better yet have the customer do this themselves by clicking Admin -> Printer Functions -> Reset Print server and clicking the reset button.  This is a very useful function and may be used by them in the future instead of calling support each time their printer does not print.  The printer should now start printing.

If the paper settings did not change, open a ticket to HW/Comm describing the steps you took and including the serial number.  The SN can be found inside the top cover where the toner cartridge is - it always begins with the letters CN. The SN can also be found under the Event Log on the Information tab when you are logged into the printer as indicated above."

*** Password Requirements ***
As of December 4, 2017

?	All passwords should be reasonably complex and difficult for unauthorized people to guess.  Associates should choose passwords that are at least fifteen characters long and must contain numbers.
?	In addition to meeting those requirements, associates must not use their User Name in their password.
?	The passwords cannot be one of your 5 previous passwords.
?	All passwords must be changed regularly, with the expiration set at 180 days.  This requirement will be enforced by the Kronos system.
?	Your first password change to the guidelines above will be required upon your first password expiration."

5. Have you called ESC, and if so what was their answer.","Questions and information to ask.
1.  Name and WINID of the associate.
2. When was his/her's last day?
3. Was he/she transferred to a WTC? - If the associate was transferred to a WTC, the associate will need to be exited by Kronos Support
4. Were they exited in MSS? - If not, this is why the associate is still in Kronos. This needs to be done immediately.
5. Have you called ESC, and if so what was their answer.

A very common question we get is ""How can I remove an exited associate from my Kronos system?  Or, ""a transferred associate is still in my system, how do I get them out?""

The process is this - When an associate is either terminated (regardless of the reason), is transferred or promoted, the DMR initiates a process in MSS (Managers Solution System??).  That then starts the process of whatever needs to be done to the associates record.  This goes through several channels, with each channel needing to ""approve"" the change.  Once HR does their part, it the flows to ESC (Employee Solutions Center).  ESC then will update the GEMS record.  GEMS will then automatically remove or change the record.  There is nothing that we SHOULD have to do to remove or change an associates record in Kronos.  This process does take several days, and at times more than a week or so.  All the store manager can do is wait for the record to fall off.  A couple of things he needs to do though:

Remove the schedule for the associate.
Make sure they have exited the associate in GBMS (This is only for GBMS purposes - Exiting an associate in GBMS does not affect Kronos at all)
Continue to sign off on the blank timecards (till the associate is removed)
And watch the process in MSS (I believe they should have access to it)
Follow up with the DMR if it's been more than a week or so to make sure that the change is flowing through the proper channels."

"3397","Unique Number Will Not Work in GBMS","NA-GBMS 3","PERSONNEL","ENTER NEW EMPLOYEE","CP3397 Unique Number Will Not Work in GBMS","Just some advice on unique numbers.

When a store hires a new associate and they have a green flag to hire an associate, the store calls ESC.  ESC goes into the mainframe (TPX) and accesses GEMS.  GEMS will generate a Unique number using an algorithm based on the start date that the store gives ESC and also the associates social security number.  The store has 10 days to enter the new associate into GBMS under personnel.  If the store fails to enter the associate into GBMS within 10 days, GBMS will not allow the entry.  The store will need to contact ESC and have a new unique number issued with a new start date.

3 main reasons a Unique # does not work in GBMS
1. Unique Number is older than 10 days
2. The Hire date being entered into GBMS does not match the Hire Date that the unique number was generated with.  (This is the most common issue)
3. The SSN being entered into GBMS does not match the SSN the Unique # was generated with.

It is important that the store make sure that the new associate has passed all new hire requirements like the background check, drug test, etc., before they get the Unique number.  For example.  If something happens with the background check and it needs more clarification before the new hire can start, it can cause his unique number to become invalid.  Getting a Unique number should be the last thing a store manager does because hiccups in the hiring process happen all the time."

"3411","Violation Error when Trying to Sign Off.","NA-GBMS 3","KRONOS","SIGN OFF ISSUES","CP3411 Receiving Violation Error when trying to sign off on timecard in Kronos.","The violation errors mean that a rule is being broken when it comes to the timecards and or schedule or both.  This is what to look for.

Kronos has two sides.  The Timecard side and the Schedule side.  Both the schedule and the timecards must match or be accounted for.  If they don't you have caused a violation and at the end of the pay period you will not be able to sign off.


Here is an example of the two most common issues:
If an associate has time punches in the timecard, but no schedule, Kronos sees that as a Violation, because if an associate has time punches he MUST BE SCHEDULED TO WORK, so Kronos is basically asking why does he have time punches but no schedule.

If an associate has a schedule created, but has no time punches, the store manager must justify why there are no time punches by either entering in those time punches manually or adding paycodes like excused no pay (ENP), sick pay or whatever needs to be entered to justify why there are no time punches for a schedule day."

- The DMR submits all promotion/transfer paper work. For example a transfer of a manager to another store or a promotion from a Manager or Service Manager or even demotions
- Once the paper work is submitted it is a manual process controlled by HR and ESC.  Once they are done with all the paperwork and the approval process, Kronos is automatically updated.
- Once the update takes place the user that was promoted and transferred, once he/she logs into Kronos, they will now log in at their new store.

WTC Managers -

Effective July 3rd, Saturday, Transaction Code 11 will no longer process deliveries to Company Owned Retail Stores.  This is due to Retail's switch off of mainframe and onto SAP processing of back end functions (accounting, finance, etc) in July.

Transaction code 71 will process delivery receipts to Company Owned Retail Stores, effective July 3rd.

Actions Required:

Friday, July 2nd:
TC 11 pending orders to company owned retail stores must be finalized or voided by close of business
Goodyear wholesale.com orders must be finalized or voided by close of business
Orders left pending in the system past 7/2 will generate errors when attempting to finalize

Saturday, July 3rd:
Begin processing Company Owned Retail Store delivery receipts using transaction code 71
Centers will need to use nonsig instead of territory to process these orders
TC71 orders over 30 line items cannot be processed by the system.  Separate large orders over multiple documents.
WTC -> WTC deliveries will continue to use TC11, as will Store -> Store movement just as today.
WTC -> Dapper and Dapper -> Store (and vice versa) will continue to use TC71 just as today.

Really no need to send them to me, or Level 3. We are 99% certain it is due to customer hierarchy changes in SAP that stopped the flow of the Advice of Shipment records to GBMS. SAP is looking into the effect of their changes now, but I seriously doubt that any shipments that were already reported (and downloaded to GBMS) are going to reported again.

Thus, any stores calling in should be advised that Goodyear is aware if the problem and working to get future reported shipments back in the flow to GBMS. In the meantime, ROM the tires in manually.

I will advise when the fix is made and GBMS can expect reported shipping advices again. Please note that dealers continue to receive report of shipments to their GBMS."

"3517","Kronos Bank Holiday - Mandatory Saturday Sign Off","NA-GBMS 3","KRONOS","SIGN OFF ISSUES","CP3517 Kronos Bank Holiday - Mandatory Saturday Sign Off","Banks will be closed in observance of Veteran?s Day next Thursday, November 11, so payday for stores will be Wednesday, November 10. To account for this, all timecards must be signed off on time this weekend.  Failure to complete this process on time presents two negative effects for stores:

?Associates may not get paid on time
?Manual checks must be created by ACS, which will result in a charge back to the store in the near future.
Please remember the importance of completing the sign-off procedure for EVERY TIMECARD on time.  Two important points:

?Sign-off must be completed for all associates assigned to the store, including any who did not log any hours that week (e.g., seasonal help, recent exits, associates on disability leave, etc.).
?If there are GBMS transmission issues, sign-off may be completed on Saturday.  This is the only acceptable reason for delaying sign-off beyond Friday.
Once sign-off is complete, managers have two options to easily confirm that transmission was completed properly:

?Review the Pay Period Genie
?Review the Approval/Sign Off tab at the bottom of each timecard.  If there is no Approval/Sign Off tab, it means the sign-off was not completed
Completing proper Kronos sign-off is critical for effective store operation.  Failing to follow the process as instructed will result in late paychecks and unnecessary charges to the store.  I know that I can count on all of you to do the right thing for your associates and that is process their payroll on time.

Kronos reference materials can be found under the Kronos tab on the Tools page on Pit Row.  If you have any questions, contact Kronos Support at kronos_support@goodyear.com or call (877) GY-FIXES, option 1."

What are the Paid Holidays for retail stores?
When are associates eligable for Holiday Pay?
Do Stores put the time in the Schedules for Holiday?","Questions relating to Holiday Pay for Kronos and retail Stores

What are the Paid Holidays for retail stores?
			Answer - Retail stores get two paid holidays a year, Thanksgiving and Christmas.  These are the only two Holidays that the stores are closed.

When are associates eligable for Holiday Pay?
			Answer - 90 days from the date of employement and must be Full Time ONLY.  This is coded exactly as read, if the associate hired in 89 days before   a Holiday, the will not get paid for it.  There is nothing we can do to change that.

Do Stores put the time in the Schedules for Holiday?
			Answer - No.  Holidays are automatically imported into the schedule for those that are eligable for it.  If the 8 hours of holiday pay are not imported into the schedule, then the associate is not eligable.

If a store manager believes that the associate should be eligable for Holiday Pay and is not receiving it, they will need to contact their HR Rep or ESC as Kronos Support CANNOT change the associates profile if it has been coded incorrectly."

If a terr does not run a B50 every day, then the Terr Seq will start to lag behind the DAS Seq.  Within the job there is logic that tracks activity for a terr and does not transmit a S&E to the terr if there is no data to process since it would be identical to his last S&E.

We recently started running seven days a week so locations that are not open on Sundays will see  the difference in the sequence #'s.  The DAS Seq #'s will skip but their Terr Seq should not skip.  We will send them an S&E when we have updated data to send them."

Unapplied cash is money that has not been applied to an invoice.  It is usually there because the account has OVER PAID and the remaining amount has gone into unapplied cash.  It could also be money taken in on a lay-a-way account and the customer has never came back to finish the purchase.  Unapplied cash could be money that is owed to the customer.  We cannot tell if the money is owed, that is up to the store manager to do the research and find out why the money is sitting in unapplied.

1.  If the money is owed to the customer a ROC check must be issued.  Use C/P# 0113 for those instructions.

2.  if after the store manager has researched and cannot discern if the money owed and need to clear the account here is how it is processed in GBMS.
(Per Retail - Brian Dougherty - this is the correct process and is how a Auditor would want to see this money cleared)

1. Go to AR - Then Choose Option 2 for AR Options
2. Enter Emp #, Option 6 journal tickets, Hit Enter
3. Choose A/R Journal Ticket
4. Enter in the account number
5. Nex to ""REASON"" type in ""CLEAR AR JOURNAL TICKET""
6. In the Amount Field enter in a positive amount equal to the Unapplied Cash amount. HIT ENTER
7. You will then see a line that shows 'CODE 100     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE   AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT"".  This is correct.
8. Go to the ""CODE"" field and enter code ""607""
9. In the amount field now enter the same dollar amount BUT AS A NEGATIVE AMOUNT.  HIT ENTER
10. You will now see two lines that offset each other.
11. GBMS will prompt for a due date - IGNORE THIS by hitting F7
12. Hit F7 again to ""FINAL PRINT""
13. Go in to AR payments and into the account.  You should then see the Journal Ticket on the customers account.
14. Follow the normal steps to apply unapplied cash found in CP# 1628"
"3674","Rebate form not automatically printing","NA-GBMS 3","POINT OF SALE","DOC TOTAL","CP3674 Q.  Dealer/Store calls stating that the rebate form is not printing at POS for the current Goodyear Promotions.  Tags - Rebates, Rebate, forms, Form, promotion, promotions.","Q.  Dealer/Store calls stating that the rebate form is not printing at POS for the current Goodyear Promotions.

A.  There are several items that must be checked first.  They are as follows.
1.  Look at the invoice the store has as an example of when the rebate did not print.  This can be done by looking at the invoice from Archived documents.  The first question to ask is ?Does this invoice qualify for the promotion??  You can go to www.goodyear.com and lookup the current promotions and view the rebate form itself.  Typically, most promotions require that 4 tires be on the invoice and that the invoice be at a certain dollar amount to qualify or one or the other.  The promotion will also indicate which products are eligible for the promotion.
For example; If the promotion calls for 4 tires and a sale amount of $299.99 or higher and it?s only good for Goodyear and Dunlop branded tires and NOT Kelly, and you have an invoice that is for 2 tires and is only $225.00 but has Goodyear?s on it, that sale does not qualify.  All final invoices must meet all criteria outlined by the Promotion.  Please read over the fine print, that?s why it?s there.

2.  Goodyear also stipulates many times that the Goodyear Card must be used for certain aspects of the sale to qualify.

3. You can also look at GBMS Plus Sales Aid to see if a tire qualifies for the promotion.  All Tires Eligible for the promotion will be displayed in GBMS Plus with a yellow highlight and an expiration date of the promotion period in the box that has the Product Code in it.

4.  Our Customer Relations team receives a ?Product Hierarchy? spreadsheet from marketing for each promotion.  They will be forwarding that to support agents for each promotion period.  This Hierarchy Spreadsheet will show all eligible product lines and codes.  This can serve as another source to verify eligible product against our GBMS Plus Sales Aid screen.
Summary ? before you open up a ticket be sure to confirm the following.
1.	Have the location give you an example of a qualifying sale ? Pull up the document ? Review the document to make sure that
		a.	The correct Number of Tires are on the invoice per the promotion details.
		b.	The sale amount qualifies.
		c.	Did the customer use a Goodyear Card or pay cash as that might be a qualifier.
		d.	Check the tires in GBMS Plus vs. the Product Hierarchy Spreadsheet to see if they both confirm product eligibility.

If you have exhausted all the options and verified that the sale does qualify, please send a ticket to Support.

Can GBMS be set to take a physical inventory after month end has already been ran?","Answer is from LEVEL 3.
There is no way to force a Physical Inventory Freeze after the fact of the expected freeze date.  We cannot chase down why their system was not set either if they feel they did set it.  If their system was not set, the most likely options are;
1. They didn't set it to begin with and maybe intended to but forgot.
2. Somone went in and turned off the indicator prior to month end.
3. When month end cutoff was ran and they were asked if they were going to take a physical inventory, they answered NO.

No other reason can be given.   Do not send a ticket to support or to level three to research."

Some G3X dealers will still see pricing until all the WTC are converted to COWD.","G3X dealer's issues:
Currently WTCs are being converted to COWD. G3X dealers who were previously able to see the amount passed onto the WTC will now see $0.00.
Some G3X dealers will still see pricing until all the WTC are converted to COWD.

Background:
The conversion of WTC to COWD has started with a couple WTCs. (000904187, 000906186, 000908185)

When a G3X received their invoices on TireHQ from a WTC, the invoice would show a dollar amount and it would inform the location that the credit has been passed onto the WTC.

When a G3X received their invoice on TireHQ from a WD, the invoice would show $0.00 and it would inform the location that the credit has been passed onto the WD.

What to do with the G3X:
The G3X will need to contact the COWD for billing issues. TireHQ will show $0.00 now.

Reasoning:
G110 are customers of Goodyear and Goodyear does the billing.
G3X and Associate dealers are customers of the WTC/WD/COWD. The price of the tires for the G3X dealers are set by the WTC/WD/COWD. Some dealers may get different prices than other dealers, depending on the volume they purchase. Since the price is between the G3X and the WTC/WD/COWD and Goodyear doesn't have anything to do with the pricing, Goodyear passes $0.00 in the invoice. It is up to the WTC/WD/COWD to give the final invoice to the G3X dealers."

Two balancing processes occur each month: the first known as the Preliminary, the second one is the Final.

Between the Preliminary and Final balancing, dealers may FAX manual journal ticket entries needed to complete their month end cutoff.

To facilitate manual balancing, worksheets are used for both Preliminary and Final processes, the Preliminary being the more complex of the two.  Financial reports to be balanced are the Operating Statement, Trial Balance and Inventory.

Figures are secured from $AVRS (in TSO) job group Z7500.  The following columns must be balanced on the Operating Statement:  Sales, Gross Profit, Expenses and Net Profit (various jobs); on the Trial Balance:  Assets and Liabilities/Capital (Z750089A and Z7500890); and under Inventory: Trial Balance (Z750089A and Z7500890), Summary of Inventory Statistics, and Stock Ledger Control (Z7500600.)"

BEST PRACTICE: Do not touch the terminal while it is going through the start up process until the GBMS Homepage is fully loaded. Clicking OK will not speed it up.

The documents will show up without bill to (and sometimes without ship to) information.  This only appears to happen with preferred fleets (document type H).  The usual fix of putting in bill to nonsig 206000 does not help.

After some testing, I have a workaround that appears to work every time.  If you (or the user) take the steps below exactly, the bill to and ship to areas will show up.

1. Delete the document under Financial -> Sales -> On Hold by hitting the checkbox next to the document and clicking ""Remove Selected Documents""
2. Go to Commercial -> Roadside Service Call Reports and find the call again.  It will be under ""New"" now.
3. Enter in the roll time, roll date and document number right on the ""New"" screen.  DO NOT click ""View Details"" - entering the data in from that screen appears to lead to blank bill to/ship to information .
4. Click ""Save Changes."" This will move the call to ""In Process.""
5. Click on the document number, which will now be a link instead of a text field.  You will see the bill to and ship to areas filled out."
