			<h2> Welcome to the </h2><h1>Star Lake Protective Association!</h1><br/>

						<img id="moon" align="left" src="index_files/moon.jpg" width="215px" height="264px">
					<p><b>The SLPA has been dedicated to preservation of Star Lake for over 100 years!</b> The Star Lake Protective Association's mission is <i>"to promote the protection and improvement
						of Star Lake and the surrounding property and environment".</i> We are a non-regulator, non-profit organization which conducts meetings twice a year and sponsors recreational
						events and activities for lake residents and visitors. See <a href="aboutSLPA.html">About the SLPA</a> for more information. </p>

					<p>Star Lake, located in northern New York State, is a small, pristine lake situated in the western foothills of the Adirondack Mountains. Star Lake shares its borders
						with a hamlet of the same name. About half of its lake residents live here year-round in winterized homes, enjoying four true "north country" seasons. Others come to Star Lake on vacations
						,weekends or "for the summer" to visit their vacation cottages, some of which are well over 100 years old, built in the true Adirondack fashion. All enjoy the cool, crystal-clear
						lake water in a great variety of ways. Fishing, swimming and all types of water sports and boiating are popular. There is a Star Lake Regatta every year for sailing enthusiats. Canoes
						and kayaks are in abundance. Many consider their "rafts" the vehicle of choice as they slowly motor around the lake in relative luxury and comfort. Motor boats and jet skis are also popular
						for tubing, knee boarding and water skiing. Star Lake has a sandbar that has been referred to as the "village green," where Star Lakers get together to socialize. There is something
						for everyone on this very special little lake.</p>

				<h2>Early Ice-out April 10, 2017!</h2>

				<p>Ice-out is officially called when the vast majority of the lake is navigable and clear of ice, except for minor accumulations in colder bays. The spring of 2012 marked
					a record early <i>March 21st </i>ice-out. Normally, ice-out occurs between the third and fourth week of April, so we are very happy to be able to navigate the lake one again. So...
				</p>

				<b> Let the 2017 lake season begin!!</b>

				<p>We thought, with a mild winter, that we might see another March
				ice-out this year. Ice was receding around the shorelines; but it
				froze again with an early April winter set-back. Ice began to let
				go once again on April 8th with very mild temps. Ice was
				honey-combed and beginning to get very dark on the 9th, when the raft
				motor was put on, in anticipation of the first ride. There was
				still quite a bit of ice by the end of the 9th, but, with the mild
				breeze, we knew it wouldn't be long--maybe tomorrow?
				The April 10th forecast was "72 and sunny." Getting up early
				to enjoy the day, I looked out to see how much ice was left and, to my
				surprise (and aggravation), I saw Mike's double-decker out in the middle
				of the lake, breaking through openings in the very weak ice, heading
				toward the cut. This was 8:30 in the morning! Not fair! But,
				as much as it pains me, I guess I have to concede that he was the first
				raft on the lake this year. I got my camera and extra coffee,
				pulled the poles on my raft and headed out to join him. It was pretty windy,
				but warm. I had to navigate around rather large chunks of ice and
				headed through the cut, where I rafted up with Mike and Dave and we
				cruised around for about 3 hours, enjoying a perfectly spectacular
				"summer day" on the lake.
				Water temp is 43 and the air temp hit the high 70's. By the end of
				the day, it was pretty much open water, with only minor ice seen in the
				colder bays.<br/>
				The following pictures were taken on the first raft ride of the 2017 season:	</p>

					<h3>Boating Safety Class Now On-line</h3>
					<a href="http://www.parks.ny.gov/recreation/boating/boating-safety-class.aspx">
						<img src="index_files/NewYorkSafeBoating.png" align="left" width="200" height="181"></a>
					<p>The NYS Parks and Recreation people have announced that anyone can
					now receive a boating safety certificate by taking the course
					on-line. This course is equivalent to the 8-hour classroom
					course offered locally in the past. Once the course has
					been successfully completed, a written certificate is issued and
					boaters can, at their option, have the certification stated on
					their driver's license, learning permit or non-driver ID, much
					like motorcycle certification is indicated on the license.<p>
					For more information about fees and how to
					enroll, <a href="https://www.boaterexam.com/usa/newyork/">follow
					this link</a>. If you are local and would like to
					know more about enrolling in a classroom Boating Safety course
					this summer, use our <a href="feedback.html">feedback form</a>
					and we will provide local instructor contact information.</p>

					<p>Currently, it is a legal requirement for <i>
					all</i> jet ski (pwc) operators and for all boat operators born
					after May 1, 1996 to successfully complete the boaters' safety
					course. For jet ski operation, only children 14
					and up can take the course and operate a PWC legally.
					Children from 10 to 1 cannot operate a boat alone unless they take and pass the course.</p>

					<p>The SLPA supports any effort to keep our lake
					and the people who use it safe and we encourage anyone who
					operates a motorized boat or jet ski to take this course.
					Hopefully this will lead to the safe, responsible operation of
					watercraft by all.</p>

					<h3>Please Use the New DEC Boat Washing Station</h3>
					<p>A <b>New Boat Washing Station</b> is in operation
					for the Clifton-Fine area as part of a pilot program by the
					State to keep invasive species at bay. The site is located
					at the corner of Rt. 3 and County Rt. 60, near J&L. The
					wash station is manned by volunteers from Paul Smith's Collegefive
					days a week from 7 am to 4 pm and will eventually be available
					seven days a week.</p>

					<p>The DEC advises boaters and anglers to check
					their boats, trailers and other fishing and boating equipment
					for any plants or animals that may be clinging to it. It's
					the law: "Following a thorough inspection, boats should be cleaned, drained and
					dried." If you stop in with your boat, you will
					receive a free careful inspection and a 140-degree power washing
					to kill free-loading plants and creatures.</p>

					<p>Lakes in the Adirondack Park are relatively
					free of invasive plants and animals so far; but there has been a
					recent push by New York State to insure that they do not get
					introduced into our pristine lakes and streams. Invasive
					species like milfoil, zebra mussels, clams, and water fleas can
					be introduced to clean lakes by careless boaters and fishermen.
					Invasive species generally come from Lake Ontario, the St.
					Lawrence river or other contaminated bodies of water clinging to
					boat bottoms, trailors and fishing gear. Boats, trailers,
					livewells, and gear need to be <i>properly</i> inspected and
					cleaned before launch into another body of water. This new
					washing station should make it easier for those who move boats
					from lake to lake. So, if you are heading across the Route 3
					corridor, please stop in for this free inspection and washing.
					And <i>please</i>, help us to keep our lakes and waterways free
					of invasives. </p>

					<h3>New York State Boater's Guide</h3>
					<p>The <a href="index_files/NYSBoatersGuide.pdf">New York State Boater's Guide</a>
						, which we have made available to members at meetings in printed form, provides a wealth of

						agencies and current legal requirements for boating
						registration, licensing and operation in New York State.
						"This guide provides basic boating safety information on such
						topics as registration, operation, equipment and rules of the
						road, however we strongly encourage every boater to sign up for
						some formal boating instruction before venturing out on their
						own." If you are new to boating; or if you would like

					<h3>SLPA Hosts Cycle Adirondacks to Star Lake</h3>
					<p>On Sunday, August 23, 2015, 150 to 200 cyclists stopped in Star Lake,
					one of six stops on their 450+ mile journey through the
					Adirondacks. While in town, SLPA volunteers took
					those interested on a raft ride, culminating in
					a get-together on the sandbar where refreshments were served. One of Star Lake's
					distinctive features is the more than 100 motorized rafts that
					slowly cruise around the lake. Cyclists got to see
					what makes this lake so special to all of us as they rode
					on these unique water crafts. After being picked up at the
					Star Lake Haven's shore, they rode over to the sandbar to partake of
					some true Star Lake hospitality and socializing, sandbar-style. Many other
					activities were planned by community leaders including a free
					concert at the school. The raft ride was
					just one of them, but as many said later, it was the most
					memorable, pleasurable experience--much positive feedback was
					received by the Cycle Adirondacks participants.</p>
