		<h4><b>"The purpose of the Association is to
		promote the protection and improvement of Star Lake and the surrounding
		property and environment."</b></h4>
		<p>Our mission statement is quoted
		from Article 2 of the SLPA By-laws.&nbsp; It describes the purpose and
		justifies the existence of the Association.&nbsp; Over 100 years ago,
		our lake-dwelling forefathers recognized the need to keep a vigil on the
		lake and its shoreline properties.&nbsp; They purchased a lake lot that
		encompassed the only outlet of the lake for the purpose of monitoring
		and regulating water level.&nbsp; Although the original weir is no
		longer functional, the SLPA continues to own and pay taxes on the outlet
		property.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The Association is non-regulatory
		and has no desire for legal authority.&nbsp; We continue to monitor the lake's
		water
		quality and
		suggest usage conventions (such as counter-clockwise traffic) in order
		to promote safety and enjoyment of the lake by all (see
		<a href="Rules_of_lake.html">Rules of the Lake</a>).&nbsp; We are a
		social organization.&nbsp; We provide opportunities for members get to know each other
		both on the lake and at meetings and SLPA functions.&nbsp; Meetings are held to address the needs and concerns of members
		and to plan activities and social events for the lake community.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>We are a non-profit organization.&nbsp;
		We fund our activities from the collection of member dues (currently $20
		per year) and by holding
		various fund-raising social events.&nbsp; Browse the
		<a href="http://slpa.info/bylaws.htm">SLPA By-laws</a> for more details
		about the organization itself.&nbsp;
		If you are a member, you can also access the
		<a href="http://slpa.info/members/archives.htm">Archives</a> in the Members' Area which
		contain historical meeting minutes.</p>
